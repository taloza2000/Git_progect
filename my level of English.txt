My name is Tatyana Lozovaya and my level of English varies depending on what I do. 
I have an Intermediate level of reading and understanding of any kind of text. 
However, when come to any programming language it increases to an advanced level. 
My listening skills are also on the intermediate level, and I can understand almost everything when someone speaks to me. 
However, my speaking skills are a bit lacking and I feel like I would need some practice before 
I can build my confidence and speak freely with a native speaker. 
I am happy to improve my English if that would be required for the role. 

						Kind regards, Tatyana.
